## GitHub Upload Steps

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add All Files
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Create Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: StudyCast login and signup system with MongoDB integration"
```

### 4. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "studycast-login")
5. Add description: "A modern login and signup system with MongoDB integration"
6. Choose "Public" or "Private"
7. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

### 5. Connect and Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Quick Start After Upload

### For Windows Users:
1. Download/clone the repository
2. Double-click `start.bat`
3. Wait for dependencies to install
4. Server will start automatically
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### For Linux/Mac Users:
1. Download/clone the repository
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x start.sh`
3. Run: `./start.sh`
4. Server will start automatically
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Manual Start:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## MongoDB Configuration

The MongoDB connection string is already configured in the server:
```
mongodb+srv://subhashkrish66_db_user:subhashkrish66_db_user@subhash1.uvonm7n.mongodb.net/studycast
```

The database name is set to "studycast" and the collection for users will be created automatically.

## Testing the Application

1. **Sign Up Process:**
   - Open the application
   - Click "Sign up"
   - Fill in the form with valid information
   - Submit the form
   - You'll be redirected to login

2. **Login Process:**
   - Use the credentials you just created
   - Click "Login"
   - You'll be redirected to the dashboard

3. **Dashboard:**
   - View your profile information
   - Test the logout functionality

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Input validation is implemented on both client and server
- CORS is properly configured

## Customization

You can easily customize:
- Colors in `styles.css`
- Database connection in `server.js`
- Validation rules in both `script.js` and `server.js`
- UI text and messages throughout the files

## Support

The application includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback. All major functionality has been tested and should work out of the box.
